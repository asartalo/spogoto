Spogoto
=======

Spogoto is an attempt to make a stack-based programming language with gotos. It is heavily inspired by the [Push 3.0 programming language](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push3-description.html), and its [gopush implementation](https://github.com/DataWraith/gopush). 

Will this work? I don't really know. :)
